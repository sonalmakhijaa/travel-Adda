    <h1 class="title">JAL MAHOTSAV 2021-22</h1>
    <div class="para">
        <p >It is a great pleasure to update you regarding the experience called Jal Mahotsav (Hanuwantiya, Khandwa).</p>

        <p>Located on the banks of the Indira sagar dam in Madhya Pradesh, Hanuwantiya is a glorious spectacle of nature.</p>
        
        <p>Clear skies dotted with majestic white clouds, emerald green foliage and, best of all, clean blue waters that remind one of the Mediterranean. A vast improvement ,you would agree, on traffic snarls, pollution and all the other accompanying annoyances of urban life.</p>
        
        <p>A watercation to Jal Mahotsav has all the elements to reinvigorate your body, mind, and spirit. It's all about tan, man and fun. If you are already making plans and wondering how to get here-the nearest airport is Indore, just 3 hours away from the Madhya Dweep islands where Hanuwantiya is located. If you are travelling by rail, you need to get off at Khandwa, 50 km away. And if you prefer the road, then Hanuwantiya is well connected to Indore, Bhopal and Khandwa.</p>
        
        <p>Jal Mahotsav is organized every year in month of December - January and the Tent City is operational with all the activities from November to February.</p>
        
        <p>Jal Mahotsav will consist of a large Tent City with 100 Luxury Tents, spread over 10 Acres. Each Tent is spaced 8 feet apart and are decorated with comfortable interiors for your stay. A dining hall offering delectable meals, sit out Gazebos, Indoor sports room Conference facilities, Kids Entertainment area, options of many Water Sports, Air Sports, Food Bazaar, Crafts Bazaar, Wellness center/Spa and engrossing cultural entertainment each day.</p>
